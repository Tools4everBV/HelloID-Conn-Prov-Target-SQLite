# HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-SQLite

| :warning: **Warning** |
|:---------------------------|
| This connector is deprecated and will no longer be maintained or updated. For most scenarios, we recommend migrating to **SQL Express** and using the [SQL Target connector](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-SQL) as a replacement. While the SQL Target connector can sometimes be used with SQLite databases, it is **not** a 1:1 replacementâ€”some changes to your configuration or queries may be required due to differences in connection methods and SQL dialects. For future-proof and fully supported setups, we advise moving to SQL Express. This repository will be archived and kept available for reference purposes only. |

| This repository contains the connector and configuration code only. The implementer is responsible to acquire the connection details such as username, password, certificate, etc. You might even need to sign a contract or agreement with the supplier before implementing this connector. Please contact the client's application manager to coordinate the connector requirements.       |
